## 3. Off-topic and low‑effort contributions

This project welcomes honest efforts to improve the code or documentation.

- **Off-topic contributions** (e.g., unrelated ideas, general support requests in a bug tracker) may be:
    - Re-directed to a more suitable place; or
    - Closed by the maintainer with a brief explanation.

- **Low-effort or unclear contributions** may be:
    - Asked to be clarified or updated; or
    - Closed if they cannot reasonably be addressed.

Handling of such contributions will be decided on a **case‑by‑case basis** by the maintainer, always aiming to stay polite and constructive.

---

## 4. Community expectations and “rating”

This project aims to be comfortable for a wide range of people, including students, hobbyists, and professionals.

- Content should remain **broadly appropriate for a general audience**.
- Occasional mild language is understandable, but **aggressive or targeted strong language is not allowed**, especially when directed at a person or group.
- NSFW, graphic, or sexually explicit content is not allowed in issues, comments, or any other project‑related communication.

There is no explicit age restriction (e.g., 18+), but the project should remain a place where people of different backgrounds can collaborate without being exposed to hostile or explicit content.

---

## 5. Contributor and maintainer rights

To keep the project healthy and sustainable for everyone involved:

### 5.1. Contributor rights

Contributors have the right to:

- Submit issues, questions, and pull requests in good faith.
- Receive polite and respectful communication in reviews and discussions.
- Ask for clarification on decisions that affect their contributions.
- Have personal information and private reports treated confidentially.

Contributors should understand that:

- Not every suggestion or pull request can be accepted.
- Issues or pull requests may be closed if they are out of scope, low‑quality, or no longer relevant.
- The maintainer ultimately decides the project’s direction, scope, and priorities.

### 5.2. Maintainer rights

The maintainer has the right to:

- Set the technical direction, goals, and scope of the project.
- Accept, modify, or reject contributions at their discretion.
- Close issues or pull requests that:
    - Are off‑topic for the project.
    - Duplicate existing reports.
    - Do not meet contribution or quality standards.
- Enforce this Code of Conduct, including taking moderation actions described below.

The maintainer is expected to use these rights responsibly and in line with the values set out in this Code of Conduct.

## 6. Self‑promotion and spam

To keep discussions focused and useful:

- **Allowed**
    - Sharing links to tools, libraries, blog posts, or resources that are directly relevant to the issue, pull request, or topic at hand.
    - Mentioning your own projects if they genuinely help solve a problem related to this repository.

- **Not allowed**
    - Posting generic promotional content or ads not clearly tied to the project.
    - Repeatedly posting the same or similar links across multiple issues or pull requests.
    - Using the repository for recruiting, job postings, or unrelated community building without prior agreement from the maintainer.

The maintainer may remove or hide spam or promotional content and, if needed, limit further participation from accounts responsible for it.

---

## 7. Reporting violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct or have any other concerns, you are encouraged to report it.

- **How to report**  
  Email: [mail.dndmapp@gmail.com](mailto:mail.dndmapp@gmail.com)  
  Please include:
    - A description of what happened.
    - Links, screenshots, or other relevant context when possible.
    - The date(s) and GitHub handle(s) that are involved, if known.

- **Confidentiality**  
  All reports will be kept **confidential** to the project maintainer, except where disclosure is required by law or needed to ensure the safety of others.

You are not required to engage with someone who is making you uncomfortable or unsafe. Reporting is always optional but appreciated as it helps keep the community healthy.

---

## 8. Response and resolution expectations

While this project is primarily maintained by a single person and response times may vary, the maintainer aims to:

- **Acknowledge reports** of Code of Conduct violations within **7 days**, where possible.
- **Review and assess** the situation within a reasonable timeframe.
- **Communicate the outcome** of the report (at least in general terms) to the reporter, if contact details are provided.

Please note:

- In some cases, especially if additional context is needed, resolution may take longer.
- For privacy reasons, the maintainer may not be able to share full details of actions taken against other individuals.
- If a report is made anonymously, it may limit the maintainer’s ability to request clarification or follow up.

---

## 9. Enforcement

Currently, the Code of Conduct is enforced by the repository maintainer.

The maintainer may take any action they deem appropriate when a violation is reported or observed. In most cases, a **gradual approach** will be used:

1. **Informal clarification**
    - A private or public reminder of this Code of Conduct.
    - Request to stop or change the problematic behavior.

2. **Official warning**
    - A clear warning that behavior is unacceptable.
    - Explanation that further violations may result in restrictions.

3. **Temporary restrictions**
    - Temporary blocking from the repository (e.g., no commenting or contributions for a defined period).

4. **Permanent restrictions**
    - Permanent blocking from the repository and removal from the community spaces controlled by this project.

For **severe violations** (e.g., credible threats of violence, persistent harassment, severe hate speech), the maintainer may skip directly to stronger actions, including immediate blocking, without prior warning.

## 10. Appeals

If you have been subject to an enforcement action and believe it was made in error or without enough context, you may:

- Reply to the communication you received, or
- Contact [mail.dndmapp@gmail.com](mailto:mail.dndmapp@gmail.com) with:
    - Your GitHub username.
    - A brief explanation of why you believe the decision should be reviewed.
    - Any additional context you think is relevant.

Because this project is currently maintained by a single person, appeals will be reviewed by the same maintainer. The maintainer will:

- Re‑consider the decision in good faith.
- Either uphold, modify, or reverse the action.

While you may not agree with the final result, the maintainer will aim to explain the reasoning as clearly as possible.

---

## 11. Maintainer responsibilities

The maintainer of this repository will:

- Take reports seriously and review them in a timely manner.
- Keep reports confidential, except when required otherwise for safety or legal reasons.
- Act consistently and in good faith when applying this Code of Conduct.
- Explain, where reasonable, why certain enforcement actions were taken.
- Follow the same expectations of respectful behavior described for all participants.

The maintainer is not obligated to:

- Engage in extended debates about moderation decisions.
- Provide detailed internal notes or private communications related to enforcement.

If, in the future, additional maintainers join the project, they will also be expected to follow and enforce this Code of Conduct.

---

## 12. No legal advice

This Code of Conduct is intended as community guidance and does not constitute legal advice. While the project is currently maintained from the Netherlands, participation is open to people from any location, and all contributors are expected to follow any applicable laws in their own jurisdiction.

---

## 13. Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open source community guidelines and practices and is tailored specifically for the `dnd-mapp/template-angular-app` project.
